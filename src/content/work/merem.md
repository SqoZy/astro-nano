At Merem, I gave courses about a new EMR (Electronic Medical Record) system to employees. These courses were held in a classroom setting, where I gave a short presentation followed by two hours of hands-on support, during which I answered questions from the attendees.

After the courses, I became a floorwalker on the hospital wards. This meant that employees could approach me directly with real-time questions whenever they encountered difficulties using the system.
