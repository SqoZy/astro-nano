At Studentaanhuis, I provided various types of ICT support. This support took place at clients' homes, where I helped everyday users with issues related to their ICT equipment. Most of the time, the problems involved printers or desktop/laptop computers.

One time, I had to install an update on an old version of Linux Ubuntu. During the installation, the PC crashed. Luckily, I didnâ€™t lose any files, but I had to manually code every part of the update to get it working again.
