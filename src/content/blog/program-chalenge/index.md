Recently, I took on a coding challenge to create a 2D starfield animation, inspired by [The Coding Train's Starfield video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17WoOqgXsRM&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH&index=1). The goal was to recreate the effect of flying through space with stars moving towards the player.

I managed to build the basic version in about half an hour, focusing on the core animation without any extra features like pausing or speed controls. It was a fun exercise in using p5.js and practicing animation techniques. You can check out the result on my [Starfield project page](/projects/project-6/starfield).

This challenge was a great way to sharpen my JavaScript, creative coding skills and 3d coding/illusions!
