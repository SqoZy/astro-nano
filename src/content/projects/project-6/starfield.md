I made this starfield after watching a video by The Coding Train. He created a basic star system in 10 minutes, and I managed to build mine in about half an hour. 

After that, I wanted to make it fancier, so I added a color selection feature that lets you choose your own color. I also added a star count option so you can increase the number of stars whenever you like. Additionally, you can adjust the speed by pressing and swiping left or right to make it slower or faster.
