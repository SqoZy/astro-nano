This game was developed by a group of five people, but only two of us actively contributed to its creation. I was responsible for several key aspects of the game. I created the zombies, including their health, damage system, and spawner. I also implemented the camera, designed the health and ammo bars, and developed the map layout along with the system to draw the map. Additionally, I created the player's movement system.

If I have time in the future, I would like to improve this game because, in its current state, it is not as good as I would like it to be. This is because you can't even play the game normally, and it doesn't have a proper game loop. This is why there is no demo and repo for the game.
