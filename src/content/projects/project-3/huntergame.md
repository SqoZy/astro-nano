This game was made in a group of four. We needed to learn how to create an online turn-based game for simplicity. I was responsible for designing the screens and working on the online updates, such as allowing players to join others in a lobby and enabling them to see the movements of other players.

It is not fully running because the server where it ran is no longer in use. When I have time, I want to change that to a server of my own so you can play the game.
