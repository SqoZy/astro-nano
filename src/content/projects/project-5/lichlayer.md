This game was developed by a group of four, and we had around four months to complete it. The theme of the game was a boss fight, featuring an end boss that spawns minions. Before reaching the boss, players first go through a tutorial phase where they learn to fight the minions. After completing the tutorial phase, players enter a large arena containing the boss. 

The boss had two main attacks: shooting orbs and throwing rocks. If an orb hits the player, it deals damage, but if it hits the ground, it spawns a minion (either a zombie or an archer). After attacking with a few orbs, the boss throws a large rock at the player. If the rock hits the player, it results in instant death. However, if it hits the ground, it creates a shockwave that the player must jump over to avoid damage. If the rock hits a pillar, the pillar is destroyed and drops health and ammo. After a short time, the pillar reappears and creates a danger zone around itself that damages the player if they stand on it.

The boss also has a personal shield maintained by summoners scattered around the arena. The player must kill the summoners to disable the shield and damage the boss.

I was responsible for creating the weapon experience. This included designing the shooting mechanics, such as screen shaking, smoke effects from the barrel, and bullet tracers. I also implemented the ammo indicator, integrated player animations, and developed the player movement system. Additionally, I integrated the models for all the enemies, created an animation tree for each enemy, and modified the code to switch between different animations. The animations were created using Mixamo.
