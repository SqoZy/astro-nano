This game I made in a group of 4, we had around 4 months to make this game. The theme of the game was a bossfight, where we have an end boss that spawns minions.

I made the weapon experience, so I made the shooting feeling, the ammo indicators, and integrated the animations of the gun. I also integrated the models for the enemies and made their animation per enemy.
