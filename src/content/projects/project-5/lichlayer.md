This game i made in a group of 4, we had around 4 months to make this game. the theme of the game was a bossfight, where we have a end boss that spawn in minions.

I made the weapon experiance, so i made the shooting feeling the ammo indicators and intergrated the animations of the gun. I also intergrated the models for the enemies and made there animation per enemy.
