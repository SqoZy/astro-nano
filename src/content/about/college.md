I obtained my propaedeutic diploma in 2023. Currently, I am pursuing an additional thematic semester focused on Big Data, where I apply machine learning and data filtering techniques to large datasets. During my studies, I have developed several games, which can be viewed on the [project page](/projects). 

I am also working on a team project for PlugPower, where I handle incoming data filtering and transmission.
